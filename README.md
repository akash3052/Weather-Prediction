# Weather-Prediction
The problem statement is to recognize the weather condition in the
given picture by using extracted useful features from the image.
For some image recognition tasks or computer vision studies, intuition
and illumination kinds of difficulties may cause unexpected results. It
can be tricky to define weather conditions from a given scene. Even
human eyes and brain can be insufficient to recognize weather patterns.
Thatâ€™s where an image recognition model can be helpful. Moreover,
people may want to organize pictures in their mobile phone based on
weather or season. It can also help autonomous cars, alert systems etc.
Even though this problem serves a very wide area to be researched,
there are not sufficient publications or projects done in this research
area. This makes a good case to pursue research work in this area. I did
a comprehensive study of related research work and accomplish
weather condition recognition task in a large class range.
