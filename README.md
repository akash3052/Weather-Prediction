# Weather-Prediction
The problem statement is to recognize the weather condition in the given picture by using extracted useful features from the image.

For some image recognition tasks or computer vision studies, intuitionand illumination kinds of difficulties may cause unexpected results. It can be tricky to define weather conditions from a given scene. Even human eyes and brain can be insufficient to recognize weather patterns.
Thatâ€™s where an image recognition model can be helpful.

## Dataset description:
The dataset used in this project has images divided into 5 classes:
1. Cloudy
2. Sunny
3. Rainy
4. Snowy
5. Foggy

The dataset contains a lot more images for cloudy and sunny weather than for the other 3 classes.

## Steps followed for weather prediction:
1. Feature Extraction
2. Fitting pre-trained models
3. Training on LeNet5
4. Training on AlexNet

## Feature Extraction:
During feature extraction, the following features of the images were extracted:
1. Contrast
2. Brightness
3. Haze
4. Colour histogram
5. Intensity
6. Sharpness
